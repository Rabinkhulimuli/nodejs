Your Lie in April (Japanese: 四月は君の嘘, Hepburn: Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, lit. 'April is Your Lie') is a Japanese romantic drama manga series written and illustrated by Naoshi Arakawa. It was serialized in Kodansha's magazine Monthly Shōnen Magazine from April 2011 to February 2015. The story follows a young pianist named Kо̄sei Arima, who loses the ability to perform the piano after his mother's death, and his experiences after he meets violinist Kaori Miyazono.

The manga series originated from a one-shot comic that Arakawa entered in a competition; he based the series on it and drew inspiration from the existence of musical manga, such as Beck and Nodame Cantabile. A-1 Pictures adapted Your Lie in April into an anime television series that was aired on Fuji TV's Noitamina block from October 2014 to March 2015, and an original video animation (OVA) episode was released in May 2015. A live-action film adaptation of the same name was released in September 2016. Various stage play adaptations have also been produced.

In 2013, the manga won the 37th Kodansha Manga Award in the shōnen category. By June 2017, Your Lie in April had over 5 million copies in circulation. The manga received mixed reviews; several critics praised its plot and characters but criticized the artwork and emotional aspect. However, the anime adaptation was largely praised for its plot, animation, and soundtrack.
